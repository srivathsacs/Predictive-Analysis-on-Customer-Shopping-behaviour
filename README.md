# Predictive-Analysis-on-Customer-Shopping-behaviour

This challenge proposes a problem where a prediction is required to identify a shoper's likelihood to return to the stores considering his past shopping behaviour which would help the company to target specific customers by providing promotional offers,discounts etc which would in turn increase their revenue.

I have leveraged the use of Amazon web services in this project which provided me the hands-on experience in AWS.
Initially the dataset is stored in AWS S3 bucket,later the data was migrated to AWS EC2 using puTTy.
The analysis of the dataset is done in jupyter notebook deployed on AWS EC2,which is Predictive-Analysis-on-Customer-Shopping-behaviour.ipynb
