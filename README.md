# Predictive-Analysis-on-Customer-Shopping-behaviour

This challenge proposes a problem where a prediction is required to identify a shoper's likelihood to return to the stores considering his past shopping behaviour which would help the company to target specific customers by providing promotional offers,discounts etc which would in turn increase their revenue.

I have leveraged the use of AWS S3 bucket in this project as a data source and later used for retrieving the dataset in Jupyter Notebook.
